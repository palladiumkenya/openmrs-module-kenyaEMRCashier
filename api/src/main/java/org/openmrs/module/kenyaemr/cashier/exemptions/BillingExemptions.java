     * Should contain a list of unique concept ids which are exempted from billing.
     * The convention is to have keys that map to a set of concept ids.
     * This is not prescriptive and should be up to an implementation to define which convention works
     * A sample payload can look like the below:
     * {
     *   "all": [
     *       {"concept":111, "description": "Malaria"},
     *       {"concept":112, "description": "Typhoid"},

     *       {"concept":111, "description": "Malaria"},
     *       {"concept":112, "description": "Typhoid"},
     *       {"concept":113, "description": "X-ray"}
     *     ]
     * }
     * Please note that the key can be anything, as long as the implementation takes care of the evaluation logic
     * There should be a separate logic to populate the services and commodities and a separate one to check for exemptions and bill appropriately
     * TODO: make the implementation as generic as possible
